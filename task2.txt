You can use the "typeof" operator to find the data type of a JavaScript variable.
typeof(1) - number 
typeof(1.1) - number
typeof('1.1') - string
typeof(true) - boolean
typeof(null) - object
typeof(undefined) - undefined 
typeof([]) - object
typeof({}) - object
typeof(NaN) - number

The "typeof" operator can return one of these primitive types:
    string
    number
    boolean
    undefined

The "typeof" operator can return one of two complex types:
    function
    object    

undefined
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
null
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
